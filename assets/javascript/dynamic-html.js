     I am currently a student at the University of Richmond
     studying full stack web development. Before returning to
     university, I was a Senior Communications Specialist at
     CBRE, a global commercial real estate leader. I worked in
     the marketing field from 2011 to 2019 at companies including
     CBRE, Virginia Beach Community Development Corporation, and
     Old Dominion University. I also managed my own freelance
     business, providing services in photography, graphic design,
     and web design.
   </p>

     Raised in Virginia Beach, I lived in Williamsburg, Norfolk,
     and Baltimore before moving to Richmond in spring 2018. I
     graduated with a B.S. Business Administration with a major
     in marketing from Old Dominion University in 2012.

     When I'm not coding, I'm playing video games, dancing,
     traveling, or lazing around with my two cats.
